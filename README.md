# Songness
A simple web app that uses the Spotify API to control various aspects of the Spotify song recommendation engine. 

# Implementation Details

OAuth:
- Songness allows you to sign in with Spotify, a feature that is not natively supported by Firebase Auth. The workaround:
1. A Firebase cloud function communicates with the Spotify user endpoint and retrieves access / refresh tokens. 
2. The tokens are exchanged for user data which is then stored in Firestore. 
3. A custom token unique to the user's ID is then generated by Firebase and returned for the songness client to sign in with.

Spotify API:
- The core functionality of the app is built around the Spotify REST API.
1. The /recommendations endpoint is used to generate recommendations given a seed track and optional min/max values for danceability, energy, valence, and tempo.
2. The /tracks/{id} and /audiofeatures/{id} endpoints are used to analyze seed tracks and recommendations.
